<p><b><font size=+1>Course objectives :</font></b>
This course is about the design of digital systems. 
Students will be taught about the building of the individual 
components of a computer such as ALU, register file, and RAM, and how to put them together
in constructing a computer. Students will also learn about different issues in computer design
such as hardwired control versus microprogrammed control and their implementations.
Upon completion of this course, the students should have 
a good understanding of the different parts of a computer, the different design choices for
the parts, and how they work together.
You will be able to acquire practical working knowledge of creating digital circuits using
some commercial Computer-Aided Design(CAD) tools.
