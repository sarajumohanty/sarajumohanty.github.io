<p>The examinations are approximately evenly spaced throughout the semester.
The exact dates will be announced in class at
<br>least one week before each exam. The final exam is given during final
exam week at the regularly scheduled time.
<p>Homework is due at the beginning of the class one week after it is assigned.
Late homework will not be accepted. No
<br>exception will be made to this rule, except substantial evidence is
produced to show the impossibility to perform it not
<br>involving your will.
<p>Makeup exams will not be given unless prior notification is given with
substantial, documented evidence of a reasonable
<br>excuse. In case of illness, written doctor's statement must be produced.
<p>If you need any special accommodations according to the American Disability
Act, please let me know.
<p>Questions regarding the test grades and assignments (homework) should
be directed to the TA<b><u> within</u></b>
<br><b><u>a week of returning the homework / test</u></b>. If no complaint
is formulated to the TA within one week
<br>after the grades are posted on the web page of the class IT WILL BE
CONSIDERED THAT
<br>YOU ACCEPTED THE GRADE AND THE CORRESPONDING GRADES ARE CONSIDERED
DEFINITIVE.

<p>No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination
at a day or time prohibited by his or her
<br>religious belief. In accordance with the University policy on observance
of religious holy days, students are
<br>expected to notify their instructors if they intend to be absent for
a class or announced examination prior to
<br>the scheduled meeting. PLEASE announce the TA, by e-mail, at least
ONE WEEK in advance.
<p>Studying and study groups. It may be fruitful to organize yourselves
in study groups of several students who meet at
<br>least once per week. However, homework (assignments) should be written
<b>completely
individually and independently.</b>
<p>Collaboration in writing up assignments is not allowed. All software
exercises will be automatically checked for similarities
<br>and all program copying will be dealt with as cheating, automatically
leading to an "F" grade.
<p>You are expected to attend classes. Missing classes means that you may
miss a quiz, which is not made up except very
<br>few cases (when you are able to prove by documents that a serious event,
independent on your will, definitely
<br>prevented you to attend).
<p>Brief, unannounced quizzes will be given occasionally in class. There
is no make up for missed quizzes.
<p>All news will be announced in the NEWS section of the class home page.
All changes to the website in general will
<br>appear in the NEWS section. Make sure that you check this from time to time.
