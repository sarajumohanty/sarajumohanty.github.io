<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The low-power design is driven by
various factors, such as increase in chip density and clock frequency due to
technology advances, thermal considerations, environmental concerns, reliability,
and battery life. In low-power design for battery driven portable applications,
the reduction of peak power, peak power differential, cycle difference power,
average power and energy are equally important. These are different forms of
dynamic power dissipation of a CMOS circuit, which is predominant compared to
static power dissipation for higher switching activity. The peak power, the
cycle difference power, and the peak power differential drive the transient
characteristic of a CMOS circuit. In this dissertation, we propose frameworks
for the reduction of energy and transient power through datapath scheduling
during behavioral synthesis. The parameters that can be varied to control power
consumption are supply voltage, clock frequency, switching activity and
capacitance. While varying these parameters, their interactions and trade-off
are considered. The quadratic variation of power dissipation with the supply
voltage is of specific importance. Several ILP and heuristic based scheduling
schemes are developed assuming three modes of datapath operation: single supply
voltage and single frequency (SVSF), multiple supply voltages and dynamic
frequency clocking (MVDFC), and multiple supply voltages and multicycling
(MVMC). A new metric called <i>cycle power function </i>(CPF) has been defined,
which captures the transient power characteristics of a datapath circuit.
Minimizing CPF using MVDFC or MVMC under resource constraints leads to
simultaneous reduction of energy and transient power. The cycle differential
power, a measure of cycle power fluctuation is modeled as either the absolute
deviation from the mean cycle power or as the cycle-to-cycle power gradient. To
reduce the overall power fluctuation of the datapath, the <i>mean power
gradient </i>(MPG) is minimized through datapath scheduling. Experimental
results for selected high-level synthesis benchmark circuits under different
constraints indicate that the MVDFC is a better design alternative compared to
either the MVMC or the SVSF schemes. </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Three different VLSI chips are designed and
implemented for image watermarking applications. The different chips designed
are as follows: spatial domain invisible watermarking chip, spatial domain
visible watermarking chip, and DCT domain invisible-visible watermarking chip.
All of these chips can be easily incorporated in a JPEG encoder or a digital
camera. The DCT domain chip is designed for low power applications using dual
supply voltage and dual frequency approach. The proposed architecture has a
three stage pipeline structure and also exploits parallelism to improve the
overall performance. The supply voltage and operating frequencies are fixed in
such a way that there is a throughput match between the low operating frequency
modules and high operating frequency modules. Level converters are used to
connect the modules operating at different supply voltages. It is estimated
that there is five fold reductions in average power consumption of the chip due
to its dual voltage and dual frequency mode operation. </p>
